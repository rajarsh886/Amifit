![Amifit Banner](./Amifit%20Banner.png)

> *“Train smarter, not harder — with AI watching your form.”*

**Amifit** is a smart fitness assistant that tracks your posture, counts reps, and gives live feedback — all in real time, straight from your webcam. No wearables, no fuss. Just you, your screen, and smarter workouts.

##  What Is Amifit?

Amifit was built as part of our B.Tech final year project to explore how artificial intelligence can improve fitness training at home. It’s a blend of computer vision, machine learning, and a user-friendly interface that delivers a near real-time workout assistant.

**In short, it:**

* Detects your posture via webcam
* Analyzes joint angles
* Counts reps (like pushups, squats, etc.)
* Gives instant posture correction feedback
* Tracks your progress with a fitness dashboard

## ⚒ Tech Stack

| Layer           | Tools / Frameworks                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**    | React (Vite), Tailwind CSS                         |
| **Backend**     | Node.js, Express                                   |
| **AI Models**   | Python + BlazePose, CNN, k-NN, DTW                 |
| **Integration** | `child_process` to run Python ML scripts from Node |

##  Features At a Glance

✅ Real-time pose detection
✅ Rep counting (e.g., squats, pushups)
✅ Joint angle analysis
✅ Corrective feedback (e.g., "Keep your back straight")
✅ Web-based – works with any webcam
✅ No wearables or app download needed

##  AI Magic – Under the Hood

Amifit uses **Google's BlazePose** to extract 33 body keypoints (x, y, z) from your live webcam feed. Then, using a combo of:

*  **Angle tracking** for movement recognition
*  **k-NN** & **DTW** for motion classification
*  Real-time overlays for form feedback

…it guides you through your workout just like a trainer would.

## 📁 Backend Overview

The backend is a Node.js server that interacts with Python scripts for AI predictions and posture analysis.

```
/backend
├── counter/                # Session & rep tracking
├── index.js                # Express server entry
├── package.json            # Dependencies
└── node_modules/           # Node packages
```

It communicates with the BlazePose & classifier scripts using `child_process` to give real-time responses.
